# Grand Master Plan

Anglichsk is actually derived from Interslavic, which is a fourth Slavic branch in its fictional universe. This is how it deviated:

## Vowels

### Short Vowels

A -> /æ/
E -> /ɛ/
I -> /ɪ/
O -> /ɑ/
U -> /ʌ/

### Long Vowels

A -> /eɪ/
E -> /i/
I -> /aɪ/
O -> /oʊ/
U -> /u/

Vowel length is determined by whether there used to be a final vowel. For example, Interslavic děte -> Old Anglichsk dete -> Anglichsk theethe /ðið/. However, monosyllabic words that end in a vowel such as "to" and "so" use the long vowel.

## Consonants

Consonants stay the same as they were in Interslavic, except for these changes: T and D turned into /θ/ and /ð/ before I and E, but they changed according to these rules:

Softened T or D is /θ/ when:

It's in the onset of a stressed syllable\
It's the last sound in a word that didn't have a word-final vowel

Softened T or D is /ð/ when:

It's in the onset of an unstressed syllable\
It's in the onset of a monosyllabic word\
It's the last sound in a word that used to have a word-final vowel
